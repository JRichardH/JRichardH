I'm an older hobby programmer: 
have developed apps in TurboPascal, 
dBase III/IV, Delphi 3, and 
currently learning & writing Python 3. 

Began learning about Linux in 1982 but 
didn't actually try to install until 
about 1997 when I found MuLinux, a 
floppy based distro for 386 CPUs. 

Failed installing Debian & Redhat in 
1999. Succeeded with SuSE Linux in 2000.
Dual booting until about 2001. 
Currently running MX Linux since 2014. 

Other interests are learning about, 
baking & eating sourdough
bread.
